For now you need to manually download the js from [Releases](https://github.com/D3SOX/megadesk-card/releases) and put in your Home Assistant folder as `www/community/megadesk-card/megadesk-card.js`, then `Edit Dashboard` -> `Manage Resources` -> `Add Resource` -> URL: `/local/community/megadesk-card/megadesk-card.js?cache=1` (JavaScript module)

## Config

```yaml

## Key Differences from Linak Desk Card

This card is specifically designed for Megadesk controllers and differs from the original Linak desk card in several important ways:

- **Absolute Height Sensors**: Uses absolute height values in centimeters directly from the sensor, instead of relative height calculations
- **Optional Sensors**: Connection and moving sensors are optional, making the card work even with minimal sensor configurations
- **Default Heights**: Comes with sensible defaults for Megadesk height ranges (58.42cm - 119.38cm)
- **Simplified Configuration**: No need to calculate relative heights or manage complex sensor dependencies

## Supported languages

## Supported models
